We configure security by using different ways, some of them are as follows.

--->To Git: [Version Control System]
    * Firstly, Git is used for developing the code.
    * we can send to various integration tools by pushing that code to github repositories
    * Before performing the build process in jenkins pipeline, we can configure that code scanning analysis by using scanning tools like sonarqube
    * Sonarqube will check security of the code whether there are any bugs, bugsmells, vulnerabilities in that code.
    * likewise we are performing security to our version control system .

-->Securing CI/CD pipelines:
    * To enhance security, we implement artifact signing and verification. This ensures the integrity of our deployment artifacts by adding digital signatures, 
      and during deployment, we verify these signatures to prevent the execution of compromised or tampered code.
    * Additionally, we take extra care in managing secrets used in our CI/CD pipeline. Rather than hardcoding them into the code or configuration files, 
      we utilize secure vaults or secret management tools to protect sensitive information and limit access to authorized personnel."

-->Continuous Monitoring:  
    * Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time.
    * Utilize tools for log aggregation, anomaly detection, and intrusion detection to monitor system activities.
