We configure security by using different ways, some of them are as follows.

--->To Git: [Version Control System]
    * Firstly, Git is used for developing the code.
    * we can send to various integration tools by pushing that code to github repositories
    * Before performing the build process in jenkins pipeline, we can configure that code scanning analysis by using scanning tools like sonarqube
    * Sonarqube will check security of the code whether there are any bugs, bugsmells, vulnerabilities in that code.
    * likewise we are performing security to our version control system .

-->Securing CI/CD pipelines:
    * To enhance security, we implement artifact signing and verification. This ensures the integrity of our deployment artifacts by adding digital signatures,
